<p>Parameters that accept an Array of Model Fields are passed the same way as an Array of string parameter, using the
	"[]" notation after each value provided, but the values that can be passed are restricted to the field names for a
	specific model.  This data type is typically implemented for methods that return models, so that the number of
	fields returned can be restricted only to those the caller is interested in.  When this parameter is optional it
	typically indicates that if no fields are passed it will return all the fields for the model, but if any fields are
	passed it will return only those which are enumerated.</p>

<p>For example, an API method that has an "Array of Model Fields" parameter named "fields" and scoped to the Offer model
	could be called in the following way if the "status", "id", and "name" fields are desired:</p>

<pre>
&fields[]=status&fields[]=id&fields[]=name
</pre>
