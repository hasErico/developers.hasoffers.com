<p>A Data Object parameter type is used to provide a set of values for a model.  This parameter is typically used in
	methods that create a new instance of a model or update the values for multiple fields of an existing model.  The
	format is an object whose keys are the field names for the model with values for each being the value to set for
	that field on the model.</p>

<p>For example, an API method that has a "Data Object" parameter named "data" that is used to create Offer models
	could be called in the following way to create an Offer with values set for the "name", "status", and "description"
	fields:</p>

<pre>
&data[name]=TestOffer&data[status]=active&data[description]=TestDescription
</pre>
