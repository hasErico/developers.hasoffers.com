<p>Primitive parameter data types such as integer, string, boolean, and double, are passed to the API as simple name/value pairs.</p>

<p>For example, passing an integer value of (5) for a parameter named "foo" would be achieved by including the following in the API call:</p>

<pre>
&foo=5
</pre>

<p>* NOTE: in order to pass boolean values you should use 0 to indicate false and 1 to indicate true.  Do not pass the strings "true" or "false".</p>
