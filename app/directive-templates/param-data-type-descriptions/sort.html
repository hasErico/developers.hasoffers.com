<p>Parameters of the Sort type used on get/find type functions to order the results returned by the method.  The
	fields that can be sorted are limited to those of the model whose type the function returns.  The format of a
	sort parameter is an object having keys identifying the model field name and values specifying the direction of
	either "asc" or "desc" to order the results in ascending order or descending order, respectively.</p>

<p>For example, an API method that has a "Sort" parameter named "sort" that returns Offer model objects could be called
	in the following way to sort the results by Offer.status ascending and by Offer.id descending within each status.:</p>

<pre>
&sort[status]=asc&sort[id]=desc
</pre>
