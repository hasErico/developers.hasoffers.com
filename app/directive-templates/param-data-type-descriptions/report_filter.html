<p>Parameters of the Report Filter type are similar to the Filter type except that they are used exclusively when calling
functions that generate reports.  The format for a Report Filter is slightly different than that of normal Filter
parameters in a few ways.  The conditional must always be specified using a "conditional" index.  For conditionals that
take value parameters, and the value(s) are specified as a sibling of the conditional, indexed by the string "values".
Additionally, some of the available conditionals differ between the two filter types.  Report Filters do not support
the "OR" construct of regular filters; instead, all provided filters are "AND"ed together.</p>

<p>The "EQUAL_TO" conditional behaves like an IN clause, allowing you to filter for data where the field matches one of
the provided values.  For example, if you are applying filters to a Conversion Report and you wish to restrict the
results to conversions having either an "active" or a "pending" status you would format the report filters as follows:</p>

<pre>&filters[status][conditional]=EQUAL_TO&filters[status][values][0]=active&filters[status][values][1]=pending</pre>

<p>In addition to the "EQUAL_TO" operator, following are additional comparison operators that can be used to limit
results with a Report Filter.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>BETWEEN</strong> - Finds objects which have a field that is in a certain range, inclusive.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose date is greater than or equal to 2013-12-29 and less than or equal to 2014-01-03</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.date][conditional]=BETWEEN&filters[Stat.date][values][0]=2013-12-29&filters[Stat.date][values][1]=2014-01-03</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NOT_EQUAL_TO</strong> - Finds objects which do not have the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose status is not equal to "active"</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.conversion_status][conditional]=NOT_EQUAL_TO&filters[Stat.conversion_status][values]=active</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>LESS_THAN</strong> - Finds objects which have a value less than the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose id is less than 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.id][conditional]=LESS_THAN&filters[Stat.id][values]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO</strong> - Finds objects which have a value less than or equal to the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose id is less than or equal to 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.id][conditional]=LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO&filters[Stat.id][values]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>GREATER_THAN</strong> - Finds objects which have a value greater than the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose id is greater 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.id][conditional]=GREATER_THAN&filters[Stat.id][values]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO</strong> - Finds objects which have a value greater than or equal to the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose id is greater than or equal to 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.id][conditional]=GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO&filters[Stat.id][values]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>LIKE</strong> - Returns objects which have a value that matches the provided string.  Use the '%' character as a wildcard.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose ip begins with the string "123.456.789"</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.id][conditional]=LIKE&[Stat.id][values]=123.456.789%</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NOT_LIKE</strong> - Returns objects which have a value that does not match the provided string.  Use the '%' character as a wildcard.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose ip does not end with with the string "543.210"</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.id][conditional]=NOT_LIKE&[Stat.id][values]=%543.210</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NULL</strong> - Finds objects which have a value that is NULL.  This is not the same as an empty string; you should use the EQUAL_TO conditional to find objects whose value is an empty string.  Notice no "values" are passed for this conditional.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose ip is NULL</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.ip][conditional]=NULL</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NOT_NULL</strong> - Finds objects which have a value that is NOT NULL.  This is not the same as an empty string; you should use the NOT_EQUAL_TO conditional to find objects whose value is an not an empty string.  Notice no "values" are passed for this conditional.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve conversions whose ip is NOT NULL.</p>
		<pre>&filters[Stat.ip][conditional]=NOT_NULL</pre>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>* NOTE: Since the Report Filter does not support "TRUE" or "FALSE" conditionals, the "EQUAL_TO" or "NOT_EQUAL_TO"
conditionals should be used instead when filtering on boolean-typed report fields.  A value of "1" corresponds to
boolean true, while a value of "0" corresponds to boolean false.</p>
