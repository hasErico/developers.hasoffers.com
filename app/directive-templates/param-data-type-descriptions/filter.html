<p>Parameters of the Filter type allow the caller of an API method to restrict the results returned by the method to
those which meet certain criteria.  Fields that can be filtered are limited to those of the model whose type the function
returns.</p>

<p>The default operator for filters is an equality filter that limits results to those models with a field matching a
single value or one of a list of values.  For example, if you wish to retrieve Offers whose status is "active" and whose
currency is "USD" the following filters could be used:</p>

<pre>&filters[status]=active&filters[currency]=USD</pre>

<p>Since the default operator supports an array of values to achieve the effect of "is one of", we can update our example
to return Offers whose status is "paused" in addition to those which are "active" by using the parameter array notation
"[]" to denote a list of statuses:</p>

<pre>&filters[status][]=active&filters[status][]=paused&filters[currency]=USD</pre>

<p>The default behavior for filters is to "AND" the conditions together, so that results must meet the criteria of each
filter in order to match.  It is also possible to construct a filter that "OR"s the conditions together.  For example,
if we wish to retrieve Offers whose status is "active" OR whose currency is "USD" we could construct a filter by prefixing
each field with an "[OR]" block:</p>

<pre>&filters[OR][status]=active&filters[OR][currency]=USD</pre>

<p>In addition to the default equality operator, following are additional comparison operators that can be used to limit
results with a filter.  NOTE: They are limited to comparing against a single value, rather than a list like the default
operator.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NOT_EQUAL_TO</strong> - Finds objects which do not have the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose status is not equal to "active"</p>
		<pre>&filters[status][NOT_EQUAL_TO]=active</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>LESS_THAN</strong> - Finds objects which have a value less than the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose id is less than 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[id][LESS_THAN]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO</strong> - Finds objects which have a value less than or equal to the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose id is less than or equal to 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[id][LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>GREATER_THAN</strong> - Finds objects which have a value greater than the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose id is greater 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[id][GREATER_THAN]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO</strong> - Finds objects which have a value greater than or equal to the provided value.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose id is greater than or equal to 25</p>
		<pre>&filters[id][GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO]=25</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>LIKE</strong> - Returns objects which have a value that matches the provided string.  Use the '%' character as a wildcard.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose name begins with the string "Test"</p>
		<pre>&filters[name][LIKE]=Test%</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NOT_LIKE</strong> - Returns objects which have a value that does not match the provided string.  Use the '%' character as a wildcard.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose name does not end with with the string "Test"</p>
		<pre>&filters[name][NOT_LIKE]=%Test</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NULL</strong> - Finds objects which have a value that is NULL.  This is not the same as an empty string; you should use the EQUAL_TO conditional to find objects whose value is an empty string.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose description is NULL</p>
		<pre>&filters[description][NULL]=1</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>NOT_NULL</strong> - Finds objects which have a value that is NOT NULL.  This is not the same as an empty string; you should use the NOT_EQUAL_TO conditional to find objects whose value is an not an empty string.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers whose description is NOT NULL.</p>
		<pre>&filters[description][NOT_NULL]=1</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>TRUE</strong> - Finds objects which have a value that is the boolean true.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers which are private</p>
		<pre>&filters[is_private][TRUE]=1</pre>
	</li>
	<li>
		<p><strong>FALSE</strong> - Finds objects which have a value that is the boolean false.</p>
		<p>Example: Retrieve Offers which are not private</p>
		<pre>&filters[is_private][FALSE]=1</pre>
	</li>
</ul>
