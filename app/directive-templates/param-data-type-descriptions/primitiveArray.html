<p>Array parameters are passed to the API with a format used by PHP and other common web scripting languages,
	utilizing a "[]" notation after each instance of the parameter name to indicate that it should be parsed as an array.</p>

<p>For example, passing an array of integers (1, 2, 5) for a parameter named "foo" would be achieved by including the following in the API call:</p>

<pre>
&foo[]=1&foo[]=2&foo[]=5
</pre>

<p>* NOTE: Arrays of type "mixed" do not enforce the data type of the array values.  This indicates that the parameter can accept strings or numbers.</p>
