<p>An Unstructured Object parameter type is used to provide multiple key/value pairs.  It is identical to the
	"Strucutred Object" parameter type, except that the keys are not predefined.</p>

<p>For example, an API method that has an "Unstructured Object" parameter named "urlparams" that is used to generate a
	tracking link that the user can attach arbitrary additional parameters to could be called like this, using any
	combination of keys/values that the caller desires to pass:</p>

<pre>
&urlparams[foo]=bar&urlparams[biz]=baz
</pre>
