<p>A Structured Object parameter type is used to provide multiple key/value pairs.  The structure is identical to that
	of the "Data Object" type parameter except it is not bound to a Model.</p>

<p>For example, an API method that has a "Structured Object" parameter named "options" that is used to specify a couple
	configurations ("name" and "frequency") could be called in the following way:</p>

<pre>
&options[name]=test&options[frequency]=weekly
</pre>
